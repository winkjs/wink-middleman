winkNLP is a JavaScript library for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Designed specifically to make development of NLP solutions **easier** and **faster**, winkNLP is optimized for the right balance of performance and accuracy.  The package can handle large amount of raw text at speeds over **500,000 tokens/second**. And with a test coverage of ~100%, winkNLP is a tool for building production grade systems with confidence.

## Features
It packs a rich feature set into a small foot print codebase of [under 1500 lines](https://coveralls.io/github/winkjs/wink-nlp?branch=master):

1. Lossless tokenizer
2. Developer friendly and intuitive API
3. Built-in API to aid text visualization
4. Easy information extraction from raw text
5. Extensive text pre-processing features
6. Pre-trained models with sizes starting from &lt;3MB onwards
7. Word vector integration
8. Comprehensive NLP pipeline covering tokenization, sentence boundary detection, negation handling, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, custom entities detection and pattern matching
9. No external dependencies.


## Installation

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wink-nlp) install:

<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>npm install wink-nlp --save</code></pre>

In order to use winkNLP after its installation, you also need to install a language model. The following command installs the latest version of default language model ‚Äî the light weight English language model called `wink-eng-lite-model`.

<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>node -e "require( 'wink-nlp/models/install' )"</code></pre>

Any required model can be installed by specifying its name as the last parameter in the above command. For example:
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>node -e "require( 'wink-nlp/models/install' )" wink-eng-lite-model</code></pre>

## Getting Started
The "Hello World!" in winkNLP is given below. As the next step, we recommend a dive into [winkNLP's concepts](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/getting-started.html).

<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>// Boilerplate Code.
// Load wink-nlp package.
var winkNLP = require( 'wink-nlp' );
// Load "its" helper to extract item properties.
const its = require( 'wink-nlp/src/its.js' );
// Load english language model ‚Äî light version.
var model = require( 'wink-eng-lite-model' );
// Instantiate winkNLP.
var nlp = winkNLP( model );

// NLP Code.
var text = 'Hello   Worldüåé! How are you?';
var doc = nlp.readDoc( text );
console.log( doc.out() );
// -> Hello   Worldüåé! How are you?
console.log( doc.sentences().out() );
// -> [ 'Hello   Worldüåé!', 'How are you?' ]
console.log( doc.entities().out( its.detail ) );
// -> [ { value: 'üåé', type: 'EMOJI' } ]
console.log( doc.tokens().out() );
// -> [ 'Hello', 'World', 'üåé', '!', 'How', 'are', 'you', '?' ]</code></pre>
